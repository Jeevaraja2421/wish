            <p id="start">Hi Kaveri!! wishing you many more happy returns of the day. I'm wishing you to be happy and positive in any situation of your life. Your a kind hearted soul that i ever seen. Definitly the god you love won't let you down and show you a good path and that's what i'll also pray for. At any cost my prayers will reach you, potect you and be with you... and.... your somthing very special to me but i don't know why, maybe <span> "if my life was a book, your name occupies 90% of it's pages and still it remains incomplete" </span> . So i'm realy delighted to dedicate you a song which covers my own vocal</p>
            <p id="end">---I hope you'll enjoy it 🤗---</p>
